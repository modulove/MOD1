# MOD1 Hardware & Software Collection

Welcome to the MOD1 Workshop repository â€“ a collection of Firmwares for Hagiwo's MOD1 hardware module, featuring alternative panel designs by Modulove and 12 different firmware versions contributed by Hagiwo and fellow enthusiasts. These were made for a Workshop series by modulove in Hamburg in 2024-2025.

## Overview

**MOD1 Hagiwo** is a series of open-source, Arduino Nano-based general-purpose CV/Gate module designes designed for DIY Eurorack modular synthesizers. These modules are built with a focus on accessibility and customization. examples include:

- **Square VCO**: A square wave oscillator with V/oct (voltage per octave) support.
- **LFO**: A low-frequency oscillator ideal for generating vibrato and other modulation.

## Features

- **Open-Source & DIY Focused**  
  All schematics and code are freely available, encouraging modifications and custom builds.
  
- **Arduino Nano Based**  
  Utilizes the compact and cost-effective Arduino Nano microcontroller, making it highly accessible.
  
- **CV/Gate Functionality**  
  Designed to generate essential control voltage (CV) and gate signals used in modular synthesis.
  
- **Multiple Firmware Versions**  
  Includes 12 distinct firmware versions developed by Hagiwo, with additional contributions from the community.
